			<h2>Board Length</h2>
			<p>Board length can be important, smaller boards will be able to turn easier, 
			and because of the lighter weight it will also make performing tricks easier.
			For starting out, we recommend getting a bigger board to help with balancing and learning to ride.</p>

			<h2>Accessories</h2>
			<p>Grip tape, trucks, bearings and wheels. All of these accessories are all personal prefference. 
			The basic guide for slecting trucks is that the main axel width should line up with the ends of your board.
			More expensive trucks will have better flex to them, but the difference is not much for a beginner. Depending on the type of riding you'll be doing
			there are different wheels that will help. Softer gel wheels will be better for riding roads, hard wheels for the skate parks. The most common sizes are 52mm to 56mm.</p>

			<h2>Safety First</h2>
			<p>Its important to always wear a helmet when riding. Skateboarding is very tricky and everybody is going to fall many times. 
			When learning to ride for the first time we recommend wearing elbow and knee pads.</p>

			<h2>Beginning</h2>
			<p>The first step to learning how to skateboard is to get on with both feet and stand on it. You'll notice that the board is bery wobbly, in time you'll get used to this.
			 To start to ride you will have to figure out which foot placement you have better balance with. A quick way to figure this out is to have someone give you a light shove from behind
			 and whichever foot you extend out first is the foot youll use to lead on the board. Place this foot just behind the front screws and with your other foot gently push from the ground. You want your push leg to work as a pendulum,
			  a large swing motion and not stomping on the ground. This is the basics to help you get started on learning to ride. Remember, this will take lots of practice to get used to.</p>

			<h2>Tricks</h2>
			<p>The first 'trick' to start with is a manuel. This is when you balance on the rear wheels while moving. This is best done with a little bit of speed.
			 While moving, gently increase your weight onto your back foot. Once you get this down, you'll be able to start trying to Ollie. To Ollie you start by pushnig your back foot down on the tail, next you will jump off your back foot as it hits the ground and push your front foot 
			 forward to level out the board. The next step is to stick the landing. These are the fundamentals to learning all forms of tricks.</p>

			<h2>Be Part of the Community</h2>
			<p>Skateboarding is a lifestyle. You will meet many people along the way that will help show you new things. Eventually you will be the one showing the 
			new kids the ropes.</p>
